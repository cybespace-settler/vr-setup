# How to make vr working on egpu amd setup
## My hardware
Thinkpad E14 gen 2 AMD

Ryzen 5 4600u

24 gb

oculink egpu rx 6700 xt

Samsung Odyssey + WMR headset
## Installation
Install Windows 10 22h2(or 11 i didn't test it personally)

Disable windows update and install amd graphics 22.11.2 driver

Then install windows mixed reality portal and complete installation

After that install steam, steam vr and mixed reality for steam vr. Also some games wont work if you dont use steam vr as default openxr runtime

DON'T USE OASIS, at least it didn't work for me

Don't use internal display, because most of games won't appear on vr and use external one only, preferably through displayport

Personally i didn't got it working on modern windows versions nor linux, so this is basically last resort

If you have some issues with similiar setup, post an issue and i will try to help

Good luck
